            registered in India as an Indian nonprofit engineering and scientific 
            society dedicated to the advancement of the mobility industry in India. 
            SAEINDIA Collegiate Club of NIT Durgapur was conceived in 2007 with an 
            idea to integrate the students of the college into the international fabric 
            of automobile engineering, adhering to the core principles laid down by SAE International. 
            We are a student body composed of enthusiastic individuals, who are always at 
            a constant strife to learn. This strife is the fuel that propels us to ideate, execute, 
            and consequently deliver a dynamic gamut of events, which receive an extensive 
            participation from various institutes.The outputs of our efforts could be appreciated 
            in a better way by discussing various aspects of our club.
